              <p>The long and interesting history of the Sudoku is quite a puzzle in itself.

                The name Sudoku or more correctly 数独 comes from Japan and consists of the Japanese characters Su (meaning 'number') and Doku (meaning 'single') but the was not invented in Japan. Sudoku originated in Switzerland and then traveled to Japan by way of America.

                Sudoku has its deep roots in ancient number puzzles. For many centuries people have been interested in creating and solving them. Puzzles continue to stimulate new development in mathematics, as you can see in the film A Beautiful Mind ➚.</p>

              <p>Magic Square puzzles which involve the ordering of consecutive numbers into a square, comes to us from the mists of history.

                The Magic square is first documented in China two thousand years ago. The puzzle is both a numerical and positional problem, as all the rows, columns and diagonal lines through the grid must add up to the same number. Just as in Sudoku a number can only be used once in the grid. The aim of the puzzle is to try to devise a new ordering of the numbers to complete the puzzle starting from scratch. Solutions were considered to have mystical properties and became part of the Chinese I Ching (Book of Changes) ➚ method of telling the future.

                The 3x3 solution shown is called the Lo Shu diagram. It was regarded as the gift of the turtle from the River Lo (the turtle had the magic square inscribed on its back). This image was first printed in the first or second century CE. The magic square reached Europe from China by way of the Arabs who brought news of many of the Chinese inventions with them along the Silk Road. Thabit Ibn Qurrah (ninth century CE) is credited with introducing the magic square to the Western World.

                In Europe the first unequivocal appearance of the square is in "Albrecht Dürer's" engraving called 'Melancholia' in 1514 where a 4x4 magic square is clearly shown with an arrangement of the first sixteen numbers gives a sum of 34 in all rows, columns and both diagonals. Any philosopher of the renaissance age would know and understand the properties of magic squares.
